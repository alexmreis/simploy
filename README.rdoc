Tired of the overhead of Hudson on Tomcat? Sick of the clunkiness of JUnit tests running in Ant? Simploy is a single java class that supercedes all that for simple projects.


==1) Run Simploy on Your Build Server

  java Simploy compileCommand testsRootFolder deployCommand [password]

Example:

  cd /my/project/repository
  java Simploy "ant build" ./bin/tests "ant deploy" password123

Make sure it is running inside you project's repository and JUnit is on the classpath.


==2) Hook It Up (Optional)

Set up a post-receive hook in your git repository to call a URL on your build server, for example: http:// yourserver.com:44321/password123

On Github that's in "YourProject > Admin > Service Hooks > Post-Receive URL". Everytime Github receives a push in YourProject it will call that URL.

If you pass it the optional password argument, Simploy will listen for that on port 44321.


==3) Forget About It

Every 5 minutes and every time the hook URL is called, Simploy does a git pull. If there were new changes, it does the following:
- Execute the command passed in to *compile* your code and tests.
- Run all your classes ending in *Test* as JUnit tests.
- If all tests pass, execute the *deploy* command passed in.

That's it.
